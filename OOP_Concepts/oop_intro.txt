Object oriented programming is a programming type that organizes a group of data attributes with
functions or methods into a unit

Encapsulation - it hides some private details of a class from other objects but only methods are 
exposed.

Polymorphsm - Allows the use of a common operation in a different way or it allows program code to have 
different meaning or functions.

Inheritance - This is when properties of a class can be inherited and exended by other class 
or functions

Abstraction - It is a programming methodology in which detailss of the programming codes are 
hidde away from the user and only the essentail things are displayed to the user 

Benefits.

1.Reuse of code through inheritance 
2.Flexibility through polymorphism
3.Modularity for easier troubleshooting
